# SynthText of Mandarin Chinese

## Proposal
Since there is too less dataset of Mandarin OCR for deep learning, we adapt the code from https://github.com/ankush-me/SynthText which is SynthText in English to create our own Mandarin version of SynthText.

## Rendering

As shown above, different colors and fonts custom Chinese text can be embedded into pictures based on Syntext_Chinese_version. 

## Code
From modifying the original [Ankush’s github repository](https://github.com/ankush-me/SynthText), we can generate our own English text and change background picture arbitrarily, including detecting depth with one single picture, segmenting the picture into different geometries.

In order to plant the Mandarin text in to our own picture, more codes will be modified to suit in.
Thanks to [SynthText_Chinese_version](https://github.com/JarveeLee/SynthText_Chinese_version) and after fixing some [problems](https://github.com/JarveeLee/SynthText_Chinese_version/issues/1)
This repository works actually good now.
